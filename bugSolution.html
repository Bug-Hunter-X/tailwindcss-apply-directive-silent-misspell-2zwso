The solution is to carefully check the spelling of all utility classes used with the `@apply` directive.  Using a good code editor with autocompletion can help prevent these errors.

Corrected `bugSolution.html`:

```html
<div class="@apply bg-red-500"></div>
```

Additionally, using a linter can help catch potential issues such as this.  Tailwind's IntelliSense plugin may help with autocompletion. Thorough testing and careful review of your code are crucial for avoiding this type of bug.
